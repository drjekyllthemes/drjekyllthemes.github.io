title:  "Vienna.html - Europe's 1st Static Site (Jekyll) User Group - Start Your Own City.html"
---

Still a little early - if you happen to be in Central Europe - 
Gerald Bauer is starting up Europe's first Static Site (Jekyll) User Group in Vienna, Austria. 
The group name is Vienna.html in honor of the static nature of a Jekyll site.

Missing out? No worries - why not start your own YourCity.html group (e.g Berlin.html, Seattle.html, and so on.) Anyone?
